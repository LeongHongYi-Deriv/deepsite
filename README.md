# DeepSite 🐳

DeepSite is a coding platform powered by DeepSeek AI, designed to make coding smarter and more efficient. Tailored for developers, data scientists, and AI engineers, it integrates generative AI into your coding projects to enhance creativity and productivity.

## 🛡️ Security Notice for Production

**⚠️ Important:** If you plan to deploy DeepSite publicly, you **MUST** implement the production security measures:

- 📋 **Quick Setup**: `SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- 📖 **Full Guide**: `PRODUCTION_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` 
- 🔍 **Security Analysis**: `SANDBOX_SECURITY.md`

The default setup is **safe for local/personal use** but requires additional sandboxing for public deployment.
